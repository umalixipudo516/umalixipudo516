  Decentralized Blog Template
</h1>

A simple blog template that publishes to Arweave through Arlink integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and install**
    ```shell
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd arlink-blog
    npm install
    ```

2. **Add your blog posts**
    - Navigate to `content/blog/`
    - Create a new folder for each post (e.g., `my-post-name/`)
    - Add an `index.md` file in each folder with your content:
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Your Post Title
    date: "2024-03-21"
    description: "Brief description of your post"
    ---

    Your blog content goes here...
    ```

3. **Preview locally**
    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```
    View at `http://localhost:8000`

4. **Publish to Arweave**
    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new blog post"
    git push
    ```
    Your changes will automatically deploy to Arweave through Arlink.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for "source code".

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).





1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
